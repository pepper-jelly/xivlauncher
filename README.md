# xivlauncher

Finally, a cross-platform FFXIV launcher. It should run on Windows, macOS (really) and Linux!

This is mostly a hobby project, but should be extremely useful to macOS players who otherwise have to deal with the aging old launcher. Linux users should also appreciate not having to deal with installing XIVQuickLauncher through wine :-)

## Features
* Can use native (Windows) and Wine (macOS, Linux) versions of FFXIV.
* Can connect to the official Square Enix servers _as well_ as Sapphire servers.
* Multiple profile support!
  * For example, having a regular Square Enix profile and a test Sapphire profile. Or maybe one for DX11 and another for DX9?
  * All of the configurable settings can be configured per-profile! 
* Saving username and/or password. These are saved per-profile as well!
* Enable several (Linux) Wine-specific performance enhancements such as enabling Esync.
